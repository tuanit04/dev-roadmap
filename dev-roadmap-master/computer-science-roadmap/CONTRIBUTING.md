# Contributor guidelines

This project primarily uses GitHub for collaboration, however not all discussions are appropriate for GitHub.
Please follow these guidelines:
1. If you need help with the *academic* content of a course or are having general technical difficulties, please do not use GitHub for this.
The best place to ask these types of questions is on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensourcesociety/).
2. If you have general problems with the program not specific to any course, such as preferring textbook-style learning over MOOCs,
the subreddit is recommended as there people may be able to give you suggested alternatives.
3. If you have *specific* and *substantive* criticisms of the curriculum, i.e. problems related to the progression/content of courses it would be appropriate to [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions.
4. If you have *non-substantive* updates to make to the curriculum, such as a course's URL having been moved, spelling/syntax errors, etc., please send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.
5. If you want to customize the curriculum for yourself, do of course [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
6. If you want to suggest a new resource, send a pull request adding such resource to the [extras](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/tree/master/extras) section.

# Learning Git

To be able to create high-quality pull requests, it is recommended that you learn how to use the Git version control system.
One of the best primers on the subject is a free ebook called [Ry's Git Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QFIA5OC/).
If you prefer a course-style introduction, try [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
